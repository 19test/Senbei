Senbei by akosma
================

Senbei is an iPhone client for accessing remote servers running a copy
of [Fat Free CRM][1].

CRM?
----

"CRM (abbreviation) customer relationship management, denoting
strategies and software that enable a company to organize and optimize
its customer relations."

Senbei?
-------

Because [Senbei][2] is lightweight, tasty and, most importantly,
fat-free :) The name and icon were both suggested by the design and
branding geniuses of [Zerofee][3].

Functionality
-------------

- List pending tasks;
- Mark tasks as done;
- Create a new task;
- List contacts, accounts, opportunities, leads and campaigns (with
  page-based loading; scroll to the bottom, a new page of data loads
  automatically);
- Search contacts, accounts, opportunities, leads and campaigns;
- View comments for contacts, accounts, opportunities, leads and
  campaigns;
- Add comments for contacts, accounts, opportunities, leads and
  campaigns;
- View contacts as "address book" entries, with integrated e-mail and
  web browsing;
- Configurable to use any FFCRM instance (URL, username, password,
  done). Off the box it uses the <http://demo.fatfreecrm.com/> site as a
  default entry, with a random entry ("aaron", "ben", "elizabeth") as
  username and password;
- Lists are sorted and displayed in the same order as the underlying
  FFCRM instance.
- Displays Gravatars for accounts with e-mails.

Planned features
----------------

- Create contacts from the local address book;
- View accounts, opportunities, leads and campaigns details in a
  separate screen;
- View assigned and completed tasks.
- List users;
- View user details;
- Create cross-relations (jump from one account to its opportunities,
  and so on);
- Other things I can't remember right now :)
