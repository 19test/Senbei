Off the box it uses the <http://demo.fatfreecrm.com/> site as a\r\n  default entry, with a random entry (\"aaron\", \"ben\", \"elizabeth\") as\r\n  username and password;\r\n- Lists are sorted and displayed in the same order as the underlying\r\n  FFCRM instance.\r\n- Displays Gravatars for accounts with e-mails.\r\n\r\nPlanned features\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Create contacts from the local address book;\r\n- View accounts, opportunities, leads and campaigns details in a\r\n  separate screen;\r\n- View assigned and completed tasks.\r\n- List users;\r\n- View user details;\r\n- Create cross-relations (jump from one account to its opportunities,\r\n  and so on);\r\n- Other things I can't remember right now :)\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Fat Free CRM by [Michael Dvorkin][4]\r\n- Application name and icon by [Zerofee][3].\r\n- German translation by Martin Hering from [Vemedio][5].\r\n- Tab bar icons used with permission from \r\n  - eddit, Inc.,\r\n  - Joseph Wain / <http://glyphish.com>\r\n  - <http://www.pixelpressicons.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis code is released under a liberal BSD license.
